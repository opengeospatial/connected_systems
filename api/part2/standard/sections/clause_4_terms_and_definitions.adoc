== Terms and definitions

This document uses the terms defined in Sub-clause 5.3 of OGC06-121r9, which is based on the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, Rules for the structure and drafting of International Standards. In particular, the word "`shall`" (not "`must`") is the verb form used to indicate a requirement to be strictly followed to conform to this standard.

For the purposes of this document, the following additional terms and definitions apply.

#TODO# 

=== Application Programming Interface (API)
a formally defined set of types and methods which establish a contract between client code which uses the API
and implementation code which provides the API

=== Command


=== Control Stream


=== Connected Systems
Collections of interrelated systems consisting of information technology (IT) devices, sensors, and actuators that can seamlessly interact.

=== Datastream (or Data Stream)


=== Feature
Abstraction of real-world phenomena

[.source]
<<ISO19101, ISO-19101, definition 4.11>>

=== Observation
Act of observing a property

[.source]
<<ISO19156, ISO-19156, definition 4.10>>

=== Observation Procedure
Method, algorithm or instrument, or system of these which may be used in making an observation

[.source]
<<ISO19156, ISO-19156, definition 4.11>>

Note: In the context of the sensor web, an observation procedure is often composed of one or more sensors that transform a real world phenomenon into digital information, plus additional processing steps.

=== Property
Facet or attribute of an object referenced by a name 
Example	: Abby's car has the colour red, where "colour red" is a property of the car instance

[.source]
<<ISO19143, ISO-19143>>

=== Sensor
Type of observation procedure that provides the estimated value of an observed property at its output
Note: A sensor uses a combination of physical, chemical or biological means in order to estimate the underlying observed property. At the end of the measuring chain electronic devices often produce signals to be processed

=== Sensor Network
A collection of sensors and processing nodes, in which information on properties observed by the sensors may be transferred and processed
Note:	 A particular type of a sensor network is an ad hoc sensor network.

=== Sensor Data
List of digital values produced by a sensor that represents estimated values of one or more observed properties of one or more features
Note: Sensor data is usually available in the form of data streams or computer files.

=== Sensor Related Data
List of digital values produced by a sensor that contains auxiliary information that is not directly related to the value of observed properties
Example: sensor status, quality of measure, quality of service, etcâ€¦ When such data is measured, it is sometimes considered sensor data as well.

=== Data Component
Element of sensor data definition corresponding to an atomic or aggregate data type
Note: A data component is a part of the overall dataset definition. The dataset structure can then be seen as a hierarchical tree of data components.
