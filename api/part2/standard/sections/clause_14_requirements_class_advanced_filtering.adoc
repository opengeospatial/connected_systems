== Requirements Class "Advanced Filtering"
include::../requirements/query/requirements_class_advanced_filtering.adoc[]


=== Overview

This requirements class specifies additional filtering options that may be used to select only a subset of the resources in a collection.

All filters defined in this section are implemented using URL query parameters and are used in addition to the ones defined in other requirements classes. In particular, all parameters defined in https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/23-001r0.html#_common_resource_query_parameters[Clause 16.3] of {ogcapi-cs-1} shall also be supported on all resource types.



[[clause-datastream-query-params]]
