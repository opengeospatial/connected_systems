== UML Conceptual Models (normative)
This standard defines normative UML models with which derived encoding models as well as all future separate extensions should be compliant. The standardization target type for the UML requirements classes defined in this clause is thus a software implementation or an encoding model that directly implements the conceptual models defined in this standard.

=== Package Dependencies
The packages defined by the SensorML Model and their dependencies are shown in the figure below:

.Internal Package Dependencies

SensorML also has dependencies on several external packages defined within other standards, namely GML 3.2, ISO 19103, ISO 19108, ISO 19111, and ISO 19115, as described below.

==== Dependency on GML Feature Model and ISO TC 211 Models
A process represents a feature type as defined by the ISO General Feature Model and is thus modeled as an instance of the _metaclass_ GF_FeatureType (ISO 19109:2006). These models are further refined within the GML 3.2 standard (ISO 19136) which will provide the basis for XML encodings in the following section 8 of this specification document. This association of SensorML process with GML primarily brings recognition of SensorML processes as features and provides important identity properties.

The base feature classes in GML from which all processes in SensorML derive include AbstractGML and AbstractFeature, as shown in the figure below:

SensorML is dependent on ISO 19108:206 for Temporal Schema. In particular, the temporal elements, TM_Instant and TM_Period are used within the core SensorML model for Abstract Process. Additionally, SensorML depends on ISO 19115 for general metadata elements.

.External Package Dependencies – ISO TC 211

The SensorML standard utilizes the ISO 19115 models for common metadata properties such as citations, online resources, responsible party, and constraints. While Version 1.0 of SensorML defined encoding based on the ISO 19115 models, this version utilizes these models directly.

==== Dependency on SWE Common Data Models
In particular, SensorML is heavily dependent on the SWE Common Data Model standard for defining inputs, outputs, and parameters, as well as for specifying characteristics, capabilities, interfaces, and event properties. The SWE Common Data Models, which were originally defined within the version 1.0 SensorML specification, are in version 2.1 defined as a separate specification and are utilized throughout the SWE family of encoding and web service specifications.

The SWE Common specification provides a flexible yet robust means of defining data types and data values, including support for simple data types such as Quantity, Boolean, Category, Count, Text, and Time, as well as aggregate data such as DataRecord, DataArray, Vector, and Matrix. Additionally, SWE Common supports the concept of DataChoice, which will be utilized by SensorML for providing multiplexed messages in data streams and configurable options for processes and physical systems.

The data models in SWE Common provide additional properties than are provided by basic data types, including for example, units of measure (uom), quality indications, allowable constraints, significant digit counts, and in particular, the meaning and semantics of a data component. Both simple and aggregate data components in SWE Common allow for unambiguous definition of that data component through a resolvable link to an online dictionary or ontology. The definition of the SWE Common Data Models can be found in OGC 08-094r1.

The main objective of SWE Common Data Models is to achieve interoperability, first at the syntactic level, and later at the semantic level (by using ontologies and semantic mediation) so that sensor data can be better understood by machines, processed automatically in complex workflows, and easily shared between intelligent sensor web nodes.

SensorML depends heavily on the AbstractDataComponent element defined in SWE Common. This element serves as the base component from which all relevant data types in SWE Common are derived, including Quantity, Count, Category, Boolean, Text, DataRecord, DataArray, Vector, Matrix, and DataChoice. AbstractDataComponent thus serves as a substitution group that any of these data types can satisfy. AbstractSWEIdentifiable will serve as the basis for the ObservableProperty element defined in this specification (Section 7.2.1).

The model for the SWE Common AbstractDataComponent is given in the figure below:

==== Relationship to Observations and Measurements (O&M)
Conceptual models for Observations and Measurements are provided by ISO 19156, which also provides models for sampling feature types. XML Schema encodings of these models are provided by the OGC Observations and Measurements XML Implementation Document (OGC 10-025). The model for Observation defines a procedure of type AbstractFeature which references or describes the origin of the observation (i.e., how the observation came to be).

SensorML has an association to the O&M models but no direct dependencies on them.  The result of a SensorML process is typically considered to be an observation result if it is measuring or deriving some value of a physical property or phenomenon. Thus, the output values described in SensorML and resulting from a sensor or process may be packaged in an O&M Observation object or provided as a SWE Common DataStream. Inversely, the procedure property within an Observation instance may reference a SensorML description of the measurement process.
