=== Requirements Class: Processes with Advanced Data Types
include::../requirements/model/advancedProcess/requirements_class.adoc[]

The “Core Abstract Process” requirements class only requires the support of the record and scalar data types wherever a data type from the SWE Common standard is used.

This class also requires support for more advanced data types defined in the SWE Common standard: DataArray, Matrix, DataStream and Choice.
