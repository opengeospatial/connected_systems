== XML Schema Implementation (normative)
This standard defines a normative XML Schema grammar and a set of patterns that represent an XML implementation of the conceptual models presented in Section 7. The standardization target type for all requirements classes in this clause is an XML instance that seeks compliance with this XML encoding model.

XML schemas defined in this section are a direct implementation of the UML conceptual models described in Section 7. They have been automatically generated from these models by strictly following well-defined encoding rules described in Annex C. All attributes and composition/aggregation associations contained in the UML models are encoded either as XML elements or XML attributes but the names are fully consistent. One XML schema file is produced for each UML package.

Schematron patterns implement most additional requirements stated in Section 7. One Schematron file is produced for each XML package.

All example instances given in this section are informative and are used solely for illustrating features of the normative model. Many of these examples reference semantic information by using URLs that are resolvable to definitions maintained in one of several online ontologies:

* The OGC online registry at http://www.opengis.net/def/;
* The general sensor community ontologies at http://www.sensorML.com/;
* The SWEET ontology maintained by NASA JPL at http://sweet.jpl.nasa.gov/2.0/; and
* The MMI ontology registry and repository at http://mmisw.org/orr/.

All XML examples are marked by a light gray background and formatted with a fixed- width font.
