identifier:: /conf/xml/coreProcess/extension-coherent-with-core

target:: /req/xml/coreProcess/extension-coherent-with-core
test-purpose:: Verify that the target implementation is coherent with the core specification.
test-method:: 
Verify that all XML elements of the XML instance containing extensions can still be interpreted correctly without reading the extended information.

_Note: This test cannot be run automatically as the meaning the extension must be known and thus is not required to be implemented in the Executable Test Suite._
