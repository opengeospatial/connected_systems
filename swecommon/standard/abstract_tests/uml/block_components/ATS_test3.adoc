test-purpose:: Verify that the implementation of block component classes have a constraint that enforces the requirement.

test-method:: 
Inspect the model or software implementation.
Check that the “DataArray”, “Matrix” and “DataStream” classes have the constraint.
Inspect instances of these classes generated by the implementation to verify that an encoding method is specified whenever there are encoded values present.
